- ⚡ Fun fact: Black males, who make up 7% of the US population, commit 85% of [violent interracial\] victimizations, or 540,360 felonious assaults on Whites. While White males, 35% of the population, committed 14%, or 91,470 felonious assaults on Blacks. A police officer is 18 times more likely to be killed by a Black male, than an unarmed Black male is to be killed by a police officer.
